## OVERVIEW
This is a back-end template using express. I'm working on a comprehensive [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) template so 
I can rapidly develop new projects with basic functionality available right out of the box. 

This express template handles user authentication, authorization, server set-up, connecting to a database, and automated e-mails.

Soon, I will add more functionality to my client-side template as well as to this server-side template, 
and after that I will merge them into one ready-to-use template.
